## ✈️ Why SkyMetrics

Airlines don’t fail from lack of data.  
They fail from fragmented systems, delayed insights, and reactive decisions.

SkyMetrics solves this by:

- Connecting commercial, operational, digital, and customer data
- Turning raw events into decision-ready intelligence
- Supporting both tactical and executive decisions

This project is designed for modern airline operations, with modules mapped to real roles and responsibilities.
